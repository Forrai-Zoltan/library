      This is where I'll put my reading list. You will be able to see what I
      have read/watched, what I enjoyed, and what I recommend. I will also
      create an input field where you'll be able to give me reading/whatching
      suggestions. I'll update you when this page is ready on my
      <a href="/personal/thoughts">micro blog</a> or on my
      <a href="/cdn/rss-tweets.xml">RSS</a>.
